## Project Overview

This interface uses AngularJS to manage user interactions smoothly and jQuery for handling DOM manipulations and animations, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience. The aesthetic highlight is the dynamically animated background that emulates flowing binary digits.

## Technologies Used

- **AngularJS**: Utilized for its robust features in single-page application development that allow efficient data binding and modular design.
- **jQuery & vanilla JavaScript**: Aids in quick and concise DOM manipulations, event handling, and animation, making it easier to implement complex interactive behaviors. JavaScript also reads the pixels in the source image to determine the layout of the binary "code" background. This program can be applied to any black and white image.
- **CSS**: Responsive styling with the help
